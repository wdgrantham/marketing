                <blockquote>I know what it's like to run a traditional clothing boutique, buying a ton of inventory, tracking it, and working your butt off to sell stuff that some people just don't want.  We  wanted to provide a way for great retailers to sell amazing product without all the hassle and risk of buying inventory.  Sonlet Shops is amazing! We've teamed up with suppliers from the biggest retailers across the nation, and they've agreed to handle all the hard stuff. NO MORE INVENTORY!  NO MORE ORDERS! NO MORE INVOICING! I can just sell the stylest that I love and make just as much as I was making before.  Even better, I get my garage and my spare bedroom back!  We're so excited to share Sonlet Shops with all of the wonderful ladies that have come on this journey with us as clothing boutique owners, and we know that Sonlet Shops will bring the excitement and passion that we all used to feel about selling back into our lives, without having to empty our bank accounts or putting our family finances at risk!</blockquote>
