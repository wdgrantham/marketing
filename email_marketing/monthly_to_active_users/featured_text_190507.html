  <p>Spring is here and Sonlet is too! We're so excited to welcome Spring again, and with more sunshine and less snow and rain, we've ramped up our game here at Sonlet.  Our businesses change along with the seasons ... people stop wearing sweaters and look for short sleeves and dresses, they stop using Facebook and start texting more.  Here at Sonlet, we track all these trends and work hard to make sure that you can rely on our software to support your businesses, even when things change.  So here are a few things that we think you'll love about Sonlet this Spring.</p>
  
  <h4>Post to multiple Sonlet Parties at Once!</h4>
  <p>A couple of months ago, we gathered some feedback about how Sonlet Parties have been working, several folks voiced that they'd love to be able to list items in multiple Sonlet parties at once.  Its here. Check out the full description of this enhancement below.</p>
  
  <h4>Shipping labels enhancements</h4>
  <p>Lots more details on these below, but here's a quick synopsis:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>APO address support for military addresses</li>
    <li>Bless CSV Upload</li>
    <li>Custom package sizes for shipping labels</li>
    <li>Request signatures, shipment update emails, and Insurance</li>
    <li>Bulk labels download</li>
    <li>Auto address complete on Shipping page</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Unlike items</h4>
  <p>You can now go to the liked items list either on the Shop dashboard or the All Liked Items page and click the like button and it will unlike the item.  Please let your shoppers know about this new functionality as well... especially since we know that many of them use the Like Items feature to keep track of the stuff they have their eye on buying from you.</p>
  
  <h4>Text message marketing integrations</h4>
  <p>We've added two text message marketing integrations to Sonlet on our <a href="https://sonlet.com/apps/" target="_blank">apps page</a> that are worth taking a look at if you're trying to reengage and reinvigorate your marketing.  Text message marketing is the latest trend that many small and large businesses are using to keep an edge over the competition as the email inbox continues to get segmented and paired back by the gmail, yahoo mail, and outlook.  If you're looking to do outbound text message marketing to notify your customers about upcoming sales or when you go live, then check out <i>Text Message Alerts</i>.  They've got a fantastic integration that will make it easy to include links to your inventory items or parties right in your email blasts.  If, on the other hand, you're  always inundated with messages on Facebook messenger or your personal cell phone number, and you'd like a little help to automate your customer support, check out <i>Shout</i>.  They have a fantastic little text and facebook messenger bot that will change your business for the better.</p>
  
  <h4>IN TESTING</h4>

  <p>We're testing (and perfecting) two really big features: Post to the Wall and Sonlet Payments.  Here's the latest for those that can't wait to try them out:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Sonlet Social Post to the Wall</b> &mdash;> We're really excited to see this feature take Sonlet Social to the next level.  In the digital world that we live in our businesses depend on selling on Social Media.  With this feature, you'll be able to schedule and post to the wall of your Facebook Groups and Facebook Pages right from Sonlet Social.  We're planning to add support for Instagram (stay tuned), and you'll be able to easily post inventory items, party page links, and rewards cards links. For many of you, we hope this will make it much more convenient to get your Sonlet Inventory over to Social Media, and for others we'll save you $20 or more on social posting software subscriptions.</li>
    <li><b>Sonlet Payments</b>&mdash;> Sonlet Payments will allow you to collect payment with Sonlet, either by sending an invoice after a customer has claimed or by enabling checkout with a card on the Done Shopping page.  Payments will be optional, but to give you a reason to switch over we've built Sales Tax calculation and Sales Tax autofiling right into Sonlet Payments to save you time and money, and it includes an easier way to collect shipping and postage fees. Plus, payouts will be made directly to your bank account daily without any fees (unlike Venmo and Paypal).</li>
  </ul>
