  One huge milestone for every boutique is getting your first order.  For most boutique owners, it can take a while to crack the code. Here are a few helpful resources that will give you the confidence to get you over the goal-line:
</p>

<ul>
  
  <li>"The only thing we have to fear, is fear itself" -- There is no way to fail with Sonlet Shops, a message from Sonnie Humpherys, President, Sonlet.com</li>
  
  <li>The "Just For Me" Shop: How to order product samples on Sonlet Shops</li>
  
  <li>Boutique marketing 101: An overview of Facebook live, Messenger marketing, Instagram, and Album sales.</li>
  
</ul>

<p>
  As always, if I can help in anyway, whether you need help with the software, ordering product samples, or marketing your Sonlet Shop, I'd be happy work with you 1- on -1.&nbsp; Just grab a slot on my calendar:
